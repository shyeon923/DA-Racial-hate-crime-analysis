# Analysis on Racial Hate Crimes in the United States

*author*: Seung Hyeon Mandy Hong

# Data
Main datasets come from the Federal Bureau of Investigation Crime Data Explorer and U.S Census Bureau.

# Code
I use Python 3 to collect and clean data (Van Rossum & Drake, 2009). For descriptive and predictive analysis, we use R v4.1.3 (R Core Team, 2022).

# Description
A crime where offenders' bias against race/ethnicity/ancestry acts as a primary motivation is defined as a racial hate crime (United States Department of Justice, n.d.). In 2020, hate crime in the US hit a historic high in 12 years (Carrega & Krishnakumar, 2021). Among 7,554 incidents, 61.9% were racial hate crimes, and among those racial hate crimes, two racial groups, Black or African American and Asian, had the highest increase (146% and 173% each) (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2021). While most of the recent hate crimes involved a racial bias, past studies included all categories of hate crimes rather than focusing on racial hate crimes . Thus, this project aims to find a model that best predicts racial hate crimes. Moreover, we will subdivide racial hate crimes into two categories; anti-African American or Black and anti-Asian hate crimes.
